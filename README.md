# Simulation studies of item bias estimation accuracy

This project has been conducted under the supervision of Dr. Richard Golden at [COINS Lab](https://labs.utdallas.edu/coinslab/) in University of Texas at Dallas. In order to execute code for ECPE or TIMSS dataset, please execute RMD file DINA_2_bootstrap_ECPE.Rmd or DINA_2_bootstrap_TIMSS.Rmd respectively. The UTD Social Psychology data used as part of this study is not made publicly available hence DINA_2_bootstrap_SocialPsychology.Rmd cannot be executed.

The n_boot parameter in calculate_parameters.R file should be set to 10 during Development Phase in order to avoid longer execution times.
